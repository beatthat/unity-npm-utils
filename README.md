# Unity NPM Utils

**Unity NPM Utils helps you create, integrate, and share interdependent Unity packages**

The Unity Asset Store is a great resource but as a package manager, it has limitations. Notably, it provides no mechanism for one package to declare dependencies on another.

A practical effect of this is that the Unity ecosystem doesn't create and share small, single-task focused, interdependent code modules the way other language/platform communities do, and so the Unity community misses out on that engine of innovation and progress.

Ape leverages the mature and powerful Node JS package manager, npm, to provide Unity-friendly tools for creating, integrating, editing and sharing Unity packages.
